Setup:
Make sure you can run the simulator, and that the value of "level" in Constants.java is set to 1.
Each time you finish a level, increase this by 1 to start the next level.

Level 1:
You may only modify DriveCommands.java in the java/frc/robot/commands/level1 folder.
Can you make the robot strafe sideways?

Level 2:
You may only modify DriveCommands.java in the java/frc/robot/commands/level2 folder.
Can you make the robot rotate in place? Or drive while rotating?

Level 3:
You may only modify DriveCommands.java in the java/frc/robot/commands/level3 folder.
The robot needs to go faster. And spin faster.

Level 4:
You may modify DriveCommands.java in the java/frc/robot/commands/level4 folder and also
RobotContainer.java. Be careful - you probably only want to modify the configureNewBindings function.
The robot now does something when you press the controller button "A" (keyboard simulator is probably "z").
Does it do the right thing?
And can you make it do something when you press a different button - how about turning around a bit if "Y" is pressed?

Level 5:
You may modify RobotContainer.java, but only the configureLevel5Bindings function.
There's an area on the field where the robot needs to be very careful. Can you make it so the driver
can hold "A" and the robot will move at 20% speed?

Level 6:
Uh... complain that the level author hasn't gotten around to this yet.
Some ideas:
- how does field-relative movement work on Red alliance vs Blue alliance?
- can you write a command that turns the robot to face a specific direction when a button is pressed?
- can you write a command that makes the robot move to a specific location on the field?
- can you write a command that makes the robot move, then stop, then move again?
- can you write a fancy command that combines these and make the robot follow a path?
- ... PID tuning?
